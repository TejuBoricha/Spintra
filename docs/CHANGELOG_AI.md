## Format

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — Session Title
**AI:** [assistant name if known]
**Task:** Brief description
**Files Modified:** list of files
**Purpose:** why this was done
**Outcome:** what was achieved
**Risks:** any known risks introduced
```

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 1-2: Foundation, Bugs & Presence

**AI:** Antigravity IDE (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Fix hydration mismatch, presence bugs, host self-healing, RLS
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — added `hasMounted` pattern, presence cleanup on unmount, host batch-update for stale participants
- `supabase/migrations/0007_allow_host_update_participants.sql` (NEW) — RLS policy allowing host to update participant rows

**Purpose:**
- Hydration mismatch: `isHost` was reading localStorage during SSR, causing React hydration to fail
- Presence: users were not going offline when they closed the tab
- Host self-healing: disconnected users were stuck as "online" until the page was refreshed

**Outcome:**
- Hydration mismatch resolved — `isHost` now gated behind `hasMounted`
- Presence correctly updates on `beforeunload`, `pagehide`, and component unmount
- Host can now mark disconnected participants as offline
- All 7 DB migrations applied

**Risks:** None — additive changes only

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 3: Activity Improvements

**AI:** Antigravity IDE (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Fix biased shuffles, add confetti, add AnimatePresence
**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — added `shuffleArray<T>(arr: T[]): T[]` (Fisher-Yates)
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/bingo-activity.tsx` — replaced biased sort with `shuffleArray`
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/word-scramble-activity.tsx` — replaced biased sort with `shuffleArray`
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/trivia-activity.tsx` — replaced biased sort with `shuffleArray`
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — added `fireConfetti()` calls on wins, `AnimatePresence` on chat + participants

**Purpose:**
- `sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` is statistically biased — produces non-uniform distributions
- Confetti improves feedback for winners
- AnimatePresence makes UI feel more alive

**Outcome:**
- Fisher-Yates shuffle implemented and applied to 3 affected activities
- Confetti fires on game wins in all activities
- Smooth enter/exit animations on chat messages and participant entries

**Risks:** None — improvements only, no breaking changes

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 4: Partial Modularisation (4/14 Activities)

**AI:** Antigravity IDE (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Create RoomActivityContext, migrate 4 activities to zero-prop context pattern
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/room/[code]/context/room-activity-context.tsx` (NEW) — context, hook
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — added `listenersRef`, `registerEventListener`, `handleActivityEvent`, `RoomActivityContext.Provider`, converted 4 imports to `next/dynamic`
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/lucky-wheel-activity.tsx` — fully migrated
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/bingo-activity.tsx` — fully migrated
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/guess-number-activity.tsx` — fully migrated
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/word-scramble-activity.tsx` — fully migrated

**Purpose:**
- Previous architecture put all game state in room-client.tsx (monolith)
- Context + Pub/Sub pattern decouples activities from the root component
- `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` splits these into separate lazy-loaded JS chunks

**Outcome:**
- 4 of 14 activities are now self-contained with zero props
- `registerEventListener` / `handleActivityEvent` infrastructure in place for all remaining activities
- `npm run typecheck`: 0 errors
- `npm run lint`: 0 warnings
- `npm run build`: passes, 22 pages generated

**Risks:**
- Legacy bridge (`onActivityEventRef`) still present alongside new pattern — dual-fire for 10 legacy activities. This is intentional and will be resolved when all activities are migrated and the bridge is deleted in Step 4.

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 5: Plan Design + Documentation System

**AI:** Antigravity IDE (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Design the full 5-step modularisation plan; create AI documentation system
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `AI_HANDOFF.md` (NEW in project root) — portable resume handoff
- `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` (NEW) — living project memory
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (NEW) — full architecture documentation
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` (NEW) — this file
- `docs/AI_RULES.md` (NEW) — mandatory rules for all AI assistants

**Purpose:**
- Formalise the approved 5-step plan with industry patterns (Strangler Fig, Plugin Registry, Pub/Sub, Stable Context)
- Create a persistent AI collaboration system so any AI assistant can resume work without re-analysis

**Outcome:**
- Complete AI documentation system created
- 5-step plan fully designed and documented with exact code for each step
- `AI_HANDOFF.md` verified written to project root (20 KB)

**Risks:** None — documentation only, no code changes

---

<!-- APPEND NEW ENTRIES BELOW THIS LINE -->
<!-- Format: ## [YYYY-MM-DD] — Session Title -->

## [2026-07-04] — Session 18: HANDOFF.md Sync (End-of-Session)

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Bring `HANDOFF.md` up to date — it still described the pre-session "Dynamic UI Audio Integration" stopping point, missing this entire session's work (Sessions 11–17).
**Files Modified:**
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — added a "Current Progress" bullet per Session 11–17 change; updated "Last Completed Task"; removed chat-pagination/mobile-viewport from "Roadmap Remaining Work" (both now done) and added the room settings panel item back in from `TASKS.md`; added a "Known verification gap" note under Verification Status covering the two changes that were only statically verified, not live-tested.

**Purpose:**
- `AI_RULES.md`'s End-of-Session Checklist (and now §8) requires the handoff doc to reflect the exact stopping point before a session ends — it had drifted several sessions behind.

**Outcome:** Documentation-only change.
**Risks:** None.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Session 17: AI_RULES.md — New "Context Optimization" Section

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Add a "Context Optimization" section to `AI_RULES.md` per explicit user request.
**Files Modified:**
- `docs/AI_RULES.md` — appended new §8 "Context Optimization" (selective reading over exhaustive reading; use `START_HERE.md`/`INDEX.md`; prefer summaries; don't re-read unchanged docs mid-session; keep docs concise/archived, with `CHANGELOG_AI.md` as the explicit append-only exception). Sections 1–7 left untouched, appended as a new final section rather than renumbering, per the user's "do not modify other sections unless necessary" instruction.

**Purpose:**
- Formalizes, as a binding rule rather than a one-off file, the selective-reading philosophy introduced in Session 16's `docs/START_HERE.md`/`docs/INDEX.md`.

**Outcome:**
- Documentation-only change; no source files touched.

**Risks:** None.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Session 16: New docs/START_HERE.md + docs/INDEX.md, Removed Conflicting Root Entry Point

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Create a lightweight `docs/START_HERE.md` per explicit user request (entry point directing readers to read only task-relevant docs, not everything).
**Files Modified:**
- `docs/START_HERE.md` (NEW) — explains the AI Engineering Workflow, states `docs/` is the source of truth, directs readers to `docs/INDEX.md` and to read selectively, points to `AI_RULES.md` for the engineering constitution (not duplicated here), and states the end-of-session documentation-sync requirement. Kept under one page per the request.
- `docs/INDEX.md` (NEW) — one-line-per-file lookup table for every doc in `docs/`, created because `START_HERE.md` needed something concrete to point readers to for "read only what's relevant."
- `START_HERE.md` (DELETED, project root) — the root file from Session 8 told readers to read all 7 docs "in order" before writing any code, directly contradicting the new `docs/START_HERE.md`'s "read only what's relevant" instruction. Flagged the conflict to the user, who chose deletion over keeping both or redirecting.

**Purpose:**
- User explicitly requested this file with a specific philosophy (selective reading over exhaustive reading) different from the existing root entry point.

**Outcome:**
- Single, unambiguous entry point now exists at `docs/START_HERE.md`.
- No other files reference the deleted root `START_HERE.md` except `CHANGELOG_AI.md`'s own Session 8 entry, which is append-only and correctly reflects what existed at that time — left untouched.

**Risks:** None — documentation only.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Session 15: ER Diagram + Corrected Phantom `users` Table

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Add the Mermaid ER diagram requested in `ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE_REVIEW.md` and `TASKS.md`.
**Files Modified:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — added §12 (Mermaid ER diagram) generated directly from all 8 migration files; fixed the folder-structure listing, which was missing `0008_create_activity_prompts.sql`.
- `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` — corrected the "Database Status > Tables" list, which claimed a `users` table (username/avatar_url/xp/rank) that does not exist anywhere in the schema; those columns are actually on `room_participants` directly. Also corrected the "Primary key for rooms" note: `id` (uuid) is the literal PK, but `code` is what every foreign key and query actually targets.
- `docs/ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE_REVIEW.md` — closed its own "ER Diagram" backlog item, which had inherited the same incorrect `users`-table assumption.

**Purpose:**
- Before drawing a diagram, verified the actual schema by running `grep "create table" supabase/migrations/*.sql` directly rather than trusting `AI_CONTEXT.md`'s existing table list — which is exactly how the phantom `users` table was caught. Only 4 tables actually exist: `rooms`, `room_participants`, `chat_messages`, `activity_prompts`.

**Outcome:**
- Documentation-only change, no source files touched, so the compilation/lint/build gates don't apply here.
- ER diagram documents the two real foreign keys (`room_participants.room_id` / `chat_messages.room_id` → `rooms.code`, NOT `rooms.id`), the `replica identity full` requirement for realtime DELETE events, and the client-generated chat message ID pattern from ADR-005.

**Risks:** None — documentation only.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Session 14: Message ID Generation (Judgment Call, Not Literal Debt Item)

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Close the "Message ID Generation" debt item in `TASKS.md`.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — `generateUUID()`: added a `crypto.getRandomValues()`-based path between the `crypto.randomUUID()` fast path and the `Math.random()` last resort.

**Purpose:**
- The debt item as literally written proposed migrating to "native database UUID serialization" when browser APIs fail. Investigated first: `msg.id = generateUUID()` is generated client-side specifically so it can be used for the optimistic local render *and* passed explicitly to the `chat_messages` insert (`id: msg.id`) — this is ADR-005's fix for a duplicate-message bug caused by client/DB ID mismatches. If the database generated the ID instead, the client wouldn't know the real ID until the insert round-trip returned, breaking optimistic rendering and reintroducing exactly the bug ADR-005 fixed.
- Chose not to implement the literal suggestion for this reason. Instead made the actual improvement available without an architecture change: the existing fallback (used only when `crypto.randomUUID()` is unavailable, i.e. non-secure/non-HTTPS contexts) used `Math.random()`, which isn't cryptographically random. Swapped it for `crypto.getRandomValues()`, which has broader support than `randomUUID()` and is real entropy.

**Outcome:**
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` / `npm run build`: all pass.
- Verified the new fallback path directly: ran the exact logic in Node with `crypto.webcrypto`, generated 10 UUIDs, all matched a strict UUIDv4 regex (correct version/variant nibbles).
- In practice this fallback path is rarely hit at all — `crypto.randomUUID()` has near-universal support in any HTTPS deployment (Vercel and equivalent hosts serve HTTPS by default) since 2021-2022 across all major browsers.

**Risks:** None — the fast path (`crypto.randomUUID()`) is unchanged; only the rarely-hit fallback was upgraded, and it was verified independently before landing.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Session 13: Mobile Viewport Audit

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Audit Lucky Wheel, Bingo, and Tournament for mobile/small-screen layout bugs (per the `TASKS.md` debt item).
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/tournament-activity.tsx` — match row span: added `min-w-0 break-words`; sibling `Badge`: added `shrink-0`.

**Purpose:**
- The debt item bundled three games together, but only one was actually broken. Lucky Wheel uses a fixed `w-64 h-64` (256px) wheel with `max-w-[70px] truncate` on entry labels — safely fits any phone viewport. Bingo uses fixed `w-11 h-11` (44px) cells × 5 columns — total card width ~260px, also safe. Tournament's match rows joined all member names into a single string (`round.members.join(" vs ")`) inside a `flex items-center gap-3` row with no `min-w-0`/wrap — flex items default to `min-width: auto`, so two moderately long usernames could force the row wider than the viewport, causing horizontal overflow on narrow screens.
- Swept every other room activity for the same `.join(...)`-into-unconstrained-span pattern; none found (team-maker maps members individually; rps shows one username at a time — an existing, uniform, lower-risk pattern used across the whole app, not a localized bug).

**Outcome:**
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` / `npm run build`: all pass.
- Not live-tested at actual mobile viewport widths (would require a live room + a real device/emulator session); the fix is a standard, low-risk Tailwind flexbox correction (`min-w-0` + `break-words` is the conventional fix for this exact overflow class).

**Risks:** None — additive CSS-only change, no logic touched.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Session 12: Chat Pagination

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Implement "Load older messages" for room chat, closing the `TASKS.md` debt item.
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx`:
  - Added `hasMoreMessages` / `loadingOlderMessages` state and a `chatScrollContainerRef` ref.
  - Initial `loadMessages` effect now sets `hasMoreMessages` based on whether a full page (100) was returned.
  - New `loadOlderMessages` callback: queries `chat_messages` with `.lt("created_at", oldestLoadedMessage.created_at)`, descending, limit 50; prepends results; restores scroll position via `requestAnimationFrame` using the viewport's `scrollHeight` delta.
  - Added a "Load older messages" button above the message list, shown only while `hasMoreMessages` is true.

**Purpose:**
- Previously the chat only ever fetched the most recent 100 messages on mount with no way to see anything older — in an active/long-running room, earlier messages became permanently unreachable on rejoin.

**Outcome:**
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` / `npm run build`: all pass.
- **Not live-tested.** Chat pagination requires a real Supabase connection (no BroadcastChannel fallback exists for chat), and this sandbox cannot reach the live Supabase project, nor can a second dev-server instance be started in this directory without stopping the user's already-running server (Next.js enforces a single-instance lock per project directory). Verified via static analysis, typecheck/lint/build, and by matching an established scroll-preservation pattern — not via an actual click-through.

**Risks:**
- The `.lt()` cursor doesn't disambiguate messages sharing the exact same millisecond timestamp — accepted as a low-probability edge case rather than adding a compound cursor, per the KISS/YAGNI principle in `AI_RULES.md`.
- Scroll-position restoration assumes the `[data-slot="scroll-area-viewport"]` DOM structure inside `@base-ui/react`'s `ScrollArea` — if that internal structure changes in a future dependency bump, the scroll-restore silently no-ops (falls back to `viewport` being `null`) rather than crashing, but should be re-verified after any `@base-ui/react` upgrade.

## [2026-07-04] — Session 11: Security Fix, CI/Node Bump, Dependabot, Word Scramble UX Fix

**AI:** Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Task:** Redact a leaked DB credential, close CI deprecation warning, add dependency auditing, fix a silent-failure UX bug found via user report.
**Files Modified:**
- `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` — redacted a committed live Postgres connection string (plaintext password, matching the live `.env.local` project ref); added a "Recent Session Notes" entry documenting the fix
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `node-version: 20` → `22` (GitHub Actions deprecated Node 20 runners)
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — added `engines.node: ">=20.9.0"` (matches Next.js's own actual minimum)
- `.github/dependabot.yml` (NEW) — weekly npm + github-actions dependency update PRs
- `src/app/tools/word-scramble/page.tsx`, `src/app/room/[code]/activities/word-scramble-activity.tsx` — added `toast.error("Not quite — try again!")` on a wrong guess (previously silent apart from an easily-missed sound cue), matching the existing `toast` pattern already used in `lucky-wheel-activity.tsx`
- `README.md` — restructured with a table of contents; corrected stale "11 tools" count to 14; added the `activities/` folder to the documented project structure
- `.vscode/settings.json` (NEW) — file-nesting config for the Explorer sidebar (cosmetic only)

**Purpose:**
- The leaked connection string is a real, live credential in a public repo — highest priority per the Security decision-priority rule in `AI_RULES.md`.
- CI was silently running on a forced Node 24 override with a deprecation warning; pinning explicitly avoids drift.
- No automated dependency scanning existed (flagged as a gap in `ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE_REVIEW.md`).
- User reported "word scramble does nothing when I submit" — traced to a real bug (no visual feedback on wrong guesses), not a UX misunderstanding (bingo was separately verified as working correctly via live Playwright testing).

**Outcome:**
- Credential redacted and pushed; **rotation of the actual Supabase database password still requires manual action in the Supabase dashboard — not something an AI assistant can do.**
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` / `npm run build`: all pass.
- Word Scramble fix live-verified in the standalone page via Playwright (toast appears on wrong guess); the room-activity version was not live-tested this session because Next.js's dev-server lock prevented running an isolated second instance without stopping the user's own running dev server — the fix is an identical 3-line change to the already-verified pattern.

**Risks:**
- The leaked password must still be rotated by the user; this session's fix only prevents further exposure from the current file state, it does not undo prior exposure.
- Word Scramble room-activity fix is unverified live (see above) — low risk given it mirrors a proven pattern, but flagged for honesty per `AI_RULES.md` verification requirements.

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 10: Dynamic UI Audio Integration & Premium Sound Effects
**AI:** Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Expose soundEnabled state in Stable Context, add volume toggle control in the Room Header, and play real-time synthesized audio feedback across modular games.
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/app/room/[code]/context/room-activity-context.tsx` — Exposed `soundEnabled: boolean` inside room activity Stable Context interface
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — Initialized local sound toggle state (saving/loading preferences asynchronously from `localStorage` to avoid Next.js hydration anomalies) and rendered a mute/unmute header trigger button
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/coin-flip-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playCoinFlip` and `playTick` audio feedback on flipping events
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/dice-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playDiceRoll` and `playTick` audio feedback on rolling actions
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/truth-or-dare-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playSwipe` on card draw broadcasts
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/would-you-rather-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playSwipe` on new prompts and `playPop` on vote submissions
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/never-have-i-ever-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playSwipe` on prompts and `playPop` on confessions
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/word-scramble-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playSwipe` on new scrambled words, `playSuccess` on winner selections, and `playFailure` on local incorrect guesses
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/lucky-wheel-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playSwipe` on spins and `playSuccess` on target selections
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/trivia-activity.tsx` — Triggered `playSwipe` on questions, `playPop` on others' answers, `playSuccess` on correct player answers, and `playFailure` on incorrect player choices

**Purpose:**
- Provide premium Web Audio API synthesized sound feedback to multiplayer room games to match the single-player tool pages.
- Deliver cross-client synchronized audio cues on game progression steps.
- Give participants full local control to mute/unmute room audio feeds.

**Outcome:**
- Highly responsive sound feedback added across all 8 live activity components.
- Persistent user mute controls enabled.
- All quality gates (linting, typechecking, production compile) successfully verified.

**Risks:** None.

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 9: Database-Driven Activity Prompts & Fallback System
**AI:** Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Refactor prompt viewports to fetch dynamically from database schemas.
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/0008_create_activity_prompts.sql` (NEW) — Migration file to create and seed the dynamic activity prompts table
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/truth-or-dare-activity.tsx` — Updated to load dynamic prompts from Supabase with static backup fallbacks
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/would-you-rather-activity.tsx` — Updated to load dynamic prompts from Supabase with static backup fallbacks
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/never-have-i-ever-activity.tsx` — Updated to load dynamic prompts from Supabase with static backup fallbacks

**Purpose:**
- Migrate game prompts from hardcoded client-side script arrays into central database tables for dynamic maintenance and extensions.
- Enable high-fidelity real-time querying without losing zero-configuration local sandbox capabilities (fully preserves BroadcastChannel offline modes).

**Outcome:**
- Unified `activity_prompts` table created and seeded.
- Active prompts fetched dynamically on component mount to reduce runtime DB load.
- Automated tests, lint checks, and typechecks pass with 0 errors.

**Risks:** None.

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 8: Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline & Workflow Entrypoint
**AI:** Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Establish professional Continuous Integration workflow via GitHub Actions, apply DevOps optimizations, and create a single onboarding entrypoint.
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (NEW) — GitHub Actions CI pipeline configuration
- `START_HERE.md` (NEW) — Onboarding entrypoint and workflow pointer for developers and AI assistants

**Purpose:**
- Implement automated quality gates (caching dependencies, security audits, TypeScript typecheck, ESLint, Next production build validation, and Playwright Chromium smoke test suite).
- Secure pull request merge validation checkpoints.
- Provide a clear, single entrypoint explaining repository workflow rules and document order of operations.

**Outcome:**
- Highly optimized, secure, and cost-efficient CI pipeline created with Next.js and Playwright caches.
- `START_HERE.md` available in the project root.
- All documents, typechecks, and linter runs verified successfully.

**Risks:** None.

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 7: Trivia Question Bank Expansion, Host Controls & Chat Duplicate Hotfix
**AI:** Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Expand Trivia question bank to 50+ questions with category/difficulty filters and duplicate prevention; fix local echo chat message duplication.
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/lib/trivia-questions.ts` (NEW) — dynamic database of 50+ categorized questions
- `src/lib/types.ts` — updated `TriviaQuestionEvent` definition to carry category and difficulty fields
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/trivia-activity.tsx` — integrated questions bank, built host drop-down controls, implemented badge renders for participants, and added no-repeat deck ledger shuffler
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — changed client-side `generateId` to valid `generateUUID`, passed client-generated `id` to database `insert` block, and upgraded `isDuplicateMessage` to do timezone-robust millisecond-based `.getTime()` comparison for message duplicate checks

**Purpose:**
- Upgrade the basic Trivia game mode from a small hardcoded set of 8 questions to a robust, high-fidelity experience.
- Give hosts the capability to target specific subjects and difficulty levels.
- Settle duplicate question issues using active deck state.
- Resolve the double-rendering message bug that caused the sender's own chat message to duplicate when the database INSERT triggered a realtime broadcast with a different ID format.

**Outcome:**
- 50 categorized questions available.
- UI elements match the premium glassmorphism theme.
- Chat message duplication fully resolved by syncing client/database IDs and matching timestamps robustly.
- Typecheck, linter, and dynamic build fully verified.

**Risks:** None.

---

## [2026-07-03] — Session 6: Execution of the approved 5-step modularisation plan
**AI:** Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
**Task:** Execute all 5 steps of the approved modularisation plan.
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/lib/types.ts` — replaced Record with typed discriminated union of events, added entries for all 14 activities
- `src/app/room/[code]/context/room-activity-context.tsx` — split single context into Stable (RoomActivityContext) and Dynamic (RoomParticipantsContext) contexts
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/activity-registry.ts` (NEW) — plugin registry for dynamic loading
- `src/app/room/[code]/room-client.tsx` — updated React imports, added ErrorBoundary wrapper class, memoized contexts, and replaced JSX switch case blocks with dynamic registry render
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/coin-flip-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/dice-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/truth-or-dare-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/would-you-rather-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/never-have-i-ever-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/rps-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/team-maker-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns, replaced biased shuffle with Fisher-Yates shuffle
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/tournament-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns, replaced biased shuffle with Fisher-Yates shuffle
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/name-draw-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/trivia-activity.tsx` — migrated to context patterns
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/lucky-wheel-activity.tsx` — updated event signatures to be strictly typed

- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/bingo-activity.tsx` — updated event signatures to be strictly typed
- `src/app/room/[code]/activities/word-scramble-activity.tsx` — updated event signatures to be strictly typed

**Purpose:**
- Transition the Spintra multi-player rooms from a monolithic state system to a context-driven, lazy-loaded, isolated component-plugin system.
- Prevent unnecessary page re-renders by splitting context.
- Eliminate type assertions (`as any`) by creating a strictly typed union.
- Make all games crash-isolated with `ErrorBoundary`.

**Outcome:**
- All 14 activity modules successfully refactored and dynamically loaded.
- Zero TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck` passes).
- Zero ESLint warnings (`npm run lint` passes).
- Production build passes successfully (`npm run build` passes).

**Risks:** None.
